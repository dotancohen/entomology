Track bugs in a Git repo.


## Working principal

From [the fine manual](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects):

> Git is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.

That sounds like as good a way as any to store and distribute my bug tracker!
